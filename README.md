# LOAM_NOTED
I decided to translate the comments in Chinese for this beautiful work made by cuitaixiang (https://github.com/cuitaixiang).
And also made this word as mine: "I'm sure you've never seen more detailed loam code notes than mine!"

The translation process follows the pattern shown below, with the comment translate to English and the original comments in Chinese between brackets.
